# Exploration of FourSquare API for Targets in Major US Cities

## Summary

This script will loop through `n` cities in the US and return all `Target` store locations
within a specified radius of the city. The return of the script is a GeoJSON file. Once the GeoJSON files
are generated, you can copy and paste the contents of the files into 
https://cloud.dev.premise.com/campaign-manager/geometries/create
to generate route tags for the different Target locations.
